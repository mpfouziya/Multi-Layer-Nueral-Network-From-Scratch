# Multi-Layer-Nueral-Network-From-Scratch
Used Python programming language to build a multi layer neural network with four layers: input layer, output layer and two hidden layers to solve a multi class classification problem of an MNIST dataset. The input layer have 784 (+ one bias) units representing 784 pixel values and output layer have 10 units for representing 10 different classes. Here I had chosen 20 (+ one bias) units in the hidden layer1 and 5(+one bias) in hidden layer2.
